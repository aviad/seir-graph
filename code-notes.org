* My recommendations:
1. add requirements.txt
2. in the readme, add a simple "how to use" (1. clone this repo. 2. cd
   abc. 3. run example simulation), and then add details of parameters
   given to `simulation`. This will allow people to easily USE
   this. You have great stuff in `seir_experiments.py`, just talk
   about it in the README. If users will want to add features, they'd
   better talk to you or dig into the code. Maybe say something about
   that in the README too.
3. consider some of the refactoring in the next table, by order of
   importance. Most of them are just code style stuff.

|     | 101-118                            | instead of `setattr`/`hasattr`, I'd have a `params` dict/bunch                                                               |

|     |                                    | also has a wonderful docstring :)                                                                                            |
|     | simulation                         | what is E_left? maybe rename or explain.                                                                                     |
|     |                                    | (I called ifectious Es "EI"s). I now see it explained in line 411                                                            |
|     |                                    | I just had a "turns-to-I" calculated when moving S->E attribute, so did not                                                  |
|     |                                    | have to re-calculate this.                                                                                                   |
|   2 | simulation                         | can this be broken to smaller funcs? Ideally this should be <20 lines                                                        |
| 2.5 | simulation                         | _step funcs: many args. I'd put all of these in a dict                                                                       |
|     |                                    | and call the funcs with **params. This would make the func shorter                                                           |
|     | 798                                | factor out to separate function, or just pass `counters` to __init__                                                         |
|     |                                    | and do everything there                                                                                                      |
|     | init_states                        | all the vector usage is cool :)                                                                                              |
| D10 | init_states                        | you might have slightly "missing" Es since you filter out Is later instead or before sampling. NOT saying this is important. |
|     | init_states                        | consider retuning a dict or named tuple                                                                                      |
|     | individual_infection_probabilities | I did not get it. Could it be you're doing more work than needed?                                                            |

|     |                                    | on nodes, similar to                                                                                                         |

|     |                                    | This makes things more explicit and does not have all these (NICE) arrs                                                      |
|     | random_subset                      | by ignoring those already in the set you're doing too much.                                                                  |

|     | incubation_step                    | had E_left been an integer (of steps), no need for _EPSILON                                                                  |
|     | 569                                | `prob_exposed_detected` is probably not the right name, it's about population                                                |
|     |                                    |                                                                                                                              |
